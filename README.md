# Care-Vision-AI
 The Care Vision AI project aims to develop an AI-powered diagnostic assistant to revolutionize
disease detection processes. Traditional diagnostic methods face challenges such as time-consuming
procedures, high costs, and potential errors. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning,
Care Vision AI automates and streamlines diagnostics. Using diverse medical image datasets, including those for brain tumors, nail diseases, lung cancer, and breast cancer, the project trains AI
models to accurately identify disease patterns and features. The algorithmic approach integrates
advanced image processing techniques with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with transfer
learning enhancing efficiency. Image augmentation and exploration of alternative architectures like
RCNN ensure robustness. The project culminates in a user-friendly web portal for disease screening,
offering rapid, accurate assessments. Additionally, the project conducts a comprehensive investigation into image processing and machine learning techniques for disease detection, focusing on skin
cancer, brain tumor, pneumonia, and lung cancer. Methodologies, datasets, model architectures,
and evaluation metrics are explored, with model performance analysis and reflections on implications and future research directions concluding the study. Care Vision AI endeavors to transform
disease diagnosis, improving patient outcomes and advancing healthcare technology.
